Hello to whoever might evaluate this work!

The automation tool used is Testcafe.

To run:
  Open an administrator console from this folder and run "npm install testcafe".
  After installing, on the same console, run "testcafe chrome tests/test-google.ts". (This excecutes the test cases)


Things to note:

  For the manual test cases, I used a template from google and adapted the fields according to what I needed.
  The test case id's are matched with the automated test cases names as well as their tittles.
  I also tried to specify the automated steps with their respective manual steps.
  The homepage controls and methods are on a diferent class.


Hopefully this covers all the requirements for this "Hands-On test" and we can continue on with the selection process!!
